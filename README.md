Callouts revolving around vehicle based scenarios that commonly occur on the roadways.
All callouts are designed to spawn within a certain distance from the player initiating the callout without regards to the specific area of the map.

As of 15-July-23 all callouts are pending merges.

Stolen Police and FD (working callout names) will need to be altered to function.  This may be changed in the future.

This pack is not production ready and is still in pre-alpha.  No adjusted callouts have been tested with modifications and are not guaranteed to function.
